    The Apify API (version 2) provides programmatic access to the [Apify
    platform](https://docs.apify.com). The API is organized
    around [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
    HTTP endpoints.

    You can download the complete OpenAPI schema of Apify API in the [YAML](http://docs.apify.com/api/openapi.yaml) or [JSON](http://docs.apify.com/api/openapi.json) formats. The source code is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/apify/apify-docs/tree/master/apify-api/openapi).

    All requests and responses (including errors) are encoded in
    [JSON](http://www.json.org/) format with UTF-8 encoding,
    with a few exceptions that are explicitly described in the reference.

    - To access the API using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), we recommend the [`apify-client`](https://docs.apify.com/api/client/js) [NPM
    package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apify-client).
    - To access the API using [Python](https://www.python.org/), we recommend the [`apify-client`](https://docs.apify.com/api/client/python) [PyPI
    package](https://pypi.org/project/apify-client/).

    The clients' functions correspond to the API endpoints and have the same
    parameters. This simplifies development of apps that depend on the Apify
    platform.

    :::note Important Request Details

    - `Content-Type` header: For requests with a JSON body, you must include the `Content-Type: application/json` header.

    - Method override: You can override the HTTP method using the `method` query parameter. This is useful for clients that can only send `GET` requests. For example, to call a `POST` endpoint, append `?method=POST` to the URL of your `GET` request.

    :::

    ## Authentication
    <span id="/introduction/authentication"></span>

    You can find your API token on the
    [Integrations](https://console.apify.com/account#/integrations) page in the
    Apify Console.

    To use your token in a request, either:

    - Add the token to your request's `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`.
    E.g., `Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxx`.
    [More info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization).
    (Recommended).
    - Add it as the `token` parameter to your request URL. (Less secure).

    Using your token in the request header is more secure than using it as a URL
    parameter because URLs are often stored
    in browser history and server logs. This creates a chance for someone
    unauthorized to access your API token.

    **Do not share your API token or password with untrusted parties.**

    For more information, see our
    [integrations](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations) documentation.

    ## Basic usage
    <span id="/introduction/basic-usage"></span>

    To run an Actor, send a POST request to the [Run
    Actor](#/reference/actors/run-collection/run-actor) endpoint using either the
    Actor ID code (e.g. `vKg4IjxZbEYTYeW8T`) or its name (e.g.
    `janedoe~my-actor`):

    `https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/[actor_id]/runs`

    If the Actor is not runnable anonymously, you will receive a 401 or 403
    [response code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).
    This means you need to add your [secret API
    token](https://console.apify.com/account#/integrations) to the request's
    `Authorization` header ([recommended](#/introduction/authentication)) or as a
    URL query parameter `?token=[your_token]` (less secure).

    Optionally, you can include the query parameters described in the [Run
    Actor](#/reference/actors/run-collection/run-actor) section to customize your
    run.

    If you're using Node.js, the best way to run an Actor is using the
    `Apify.call()` method from the [Apify
    SDK](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/api/apify#apifycallactid-input-options). It
    runs the Actor using the account you are currently logged into (determined
    by the [secret API token](https://console.apify.com/account#/integrations)).
    The result is an [Actor run
    object](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/typedefs/actor-run) and its output (if
    any).

    A typical workflow is as follows:

    1. Run an Actor or task using the [Run
    Actor](#/reference/actors/run-collection/run-actor) or [Run
    task](#/reference/actor-tasks/run-collection/run-task) API endpoints.
    2. Monitor the Actor run by periodically polling its progress using the [Get
    run](#/reference/actor-runs/run-object-and-its-storages/get-run) API
    endpoint.
    3. Fetch the results from the [Get
    items](#/reference/datasets/item-collection/get-items) API endpoint using the
    `defaultDatasetId`, which you receive in the Run request response.
    Additional data may be stored in a key-value store. You can fetch them from
    the [Get record](#/reference/key-value-stores/record/get-record) API endpoint
    using the `defaultKeyValueStoreId` and the store's `key`.

    **Note**: Instead of periodic polling, you can also run your
    [Actor](#/reference/actors/run-actor-synchronously) or
    [task](#/reference/actor-tasks/runs-collection/run-task-synchronously)
    synchronously. This will ensure that the request waits for 300 seconds (5
    minutes) for the run to finish and returns its output. If the run takes
    longer, the request will time out and throw an error.

    ## Response structure
    <span id="/introduction/response-structure"></span>

    Most API endpoints return a JSON object with the `data` property:

    ```
    {
        "data": {
            ...
        }
    }
    ```

    However, there are a few explicitly described exceptions, such as
    [Get dataset items](#/reference/datasets/item-collection/get-items) or
    Key-value store [Get record](#/reference/key-value-stores/record/get-record)
    API endpoints, which return data in other formats.
    In case of an error, the response has the HTTP status code in the range of
    4xx or 5xx and the `data` property is replaced with `error`. For example:

    ```
    {
        "error": {
            "type": "record-not-found",
            "message": "Store was not found."
        }
    }
    ```

    See [Errors](#/introduction/errors) for more details.

    ## Pagination
    <span id="/introduction/pagination"></span>

    All API endpoints that return a list of records
    (e.g. [Get list of
    Actors](#/reference/actors/actor-collection/get-list-of-actors))
    enforce pagination in order to limit the size of their responses.

    Most of these API endpoints are paginated using the `offset` and `limit`
    query parameters.
    The only exception is [Get list of
    keys](#/reference/key-value-stores/key-collection/get-list-of-keys),
    which is paginated using the `exclusiveStartKey` query parameter.

    **IMPORTANT**: Each API endpoint that supports pagination enforces a certain
    maximum value for the `limit` parameter,
    in order to reduce the load on Apify servers.
    The maximum limit could change in future so you should never
    rely on a specific value and check the responses of these API endpoints.

    ### Using offset
    <span id="/introduction/pagination/using-offset"></span>

    Most API endpoints that return a list of records enable pagination using the
    following query parameters:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><code>limit</code></td>
        <td>Limits the response to contain a specific maximum number of items, e.g. <code>limit=20</code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>offset</code></td>
        <td>Skips a number of items from the beginning of the list, e.g. <code>offset=100</code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>desc</code></td>
        <td>
        By default, items are sorted in the order in which they were created or added to the list.
        This feature is useful when fetching all the items, because it ensures that items
        created after the client started the pagination will not be skipped.
        If you specify the <code>desc=1</code> parameter, the items will be returned in the reverse order,
        i.e. from the newest to the oldest items.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    The response of these API endpoints is always a JSON object with the
    following structure:

    ```
    {
        "data": {
            "total": 2560,
            "offset": 250,
            "limit": 1000,
            "count": 1000,
            "desc": false,
            "items": [
                { 1st object },
                { 2nd object },
                ...
                { 1000th object }
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

    The following table describes the meaning of the response properties:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>total</code></td>
        <td>The total number of items available in the list.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>offset</code></td>
        <td>The number of items that were skipped at the start.
        This is equal to the <code>offset</code> query parameter if it was provided, otherwise it is <code>0</code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>limit</code></td>
        <td>The maximum number of items that can be returned in the HTTP response.
        It equals to the <code>limit</code> query parameter if it was provided or
        the maximum limit enforced for the particular API endpoint, whichever is smaller.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>count</code></td>
        <td>The actual number of items returned in the HTTP response.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>desc</code></td>
        <td><code>true</code> if data were requested in descending order and <code>false</code> otherwise.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>items</code></td>
        <td>An array of requested items.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    ### Using key
    <span id="/introduction/pagination/using-key"></span>

    The records in the [key-value
    store](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/key-value-store)
    are not ordered based on numerical indexes,
    but rather by their keys in the UTF-8 binary order.
    Therefore the [Get list of
    keys](#/reference/key-value-stores/key-collection/get-list-of-keys)
    API endpoint only supports pagination using the following query parameters:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><code>limit</code></td>
        <td>Limits the response to contain a specific maximum number items, e.g. <code>limit=20</code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>exclusiveStartKey</code></td>
        <td>Skips all records with keys up to the given key including the given key,
        in the UTF-8 binary order.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    The response of the API endpoint is always a JSON object with following
    structure:

    ```
    {
        "data": {
            "limit": 1000,
            "isTruncated": true,
            "exclusiveStartKey": "my-key",
            "nextExclusiveStartKey": "some-other-key",
            "items": [
                { 1st object },
                { 2nd object },
                ...
                { 1000th object }
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

    The following table describes the meaning of the response properties:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>limit</code></td>
        <td>The maximum number of items that can be returned in the HTTP response.
        It equals to the <code>limit</code> query parameter if it was provided or
        the maximum limit enforced for the particular endpoint, whichever is smaller.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>isTruncated</code></td>
        <td><code>true</code> if there are more items left to be queried. Otherwise <code>false</code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>exclusiveStartKey</code></td>
        <td>The last key that was skipped at the start. Is `null` for the first page.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>nextExclusiveStartKey</code></td>
        <td>The value for the <code>exclusiveStartKey</code> parameter to query the next page of items.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    ## Errors
    <span id="/introduction/errors"></span>

    The Apify API uses common HTTP status codes: `2xx` range for success, `4xx`
    range for errors caused by the caller
    (invalid requests) and `5xx` range for server errors (these are rare).
    Each error response contains a JSON object defining the `error` property,
    which is an object with
    the `type` and `message` properties that contain the error code and a
    human-readable error description, respectively.

    For example:

    ```
    {
        "error": {
            "type": "record-not-found",
            "message": "Store was not found."
        }
    }
    ```

    Here is the table of the most common errors that can occur for many API
    endpoints:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>status</th>
        <th>type</th>
        <th>message</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>400</code></td>
        <td><code>invalid-request</code></td>
        <td>POST data must be a JSON object</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>400</code></td>
        <td><code>invalid-value</code></td>
        <td>Invalid value provided: Comments required</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>400</code></td>
        <td><code>invalid-record-key</code></td>
        <td>Record key contains invalid character</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>401</code></td>
        <td><code>token-not-provided</code></td>
        <td>Authentication token was not provided</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>404</code></td>
        <td><code>record-not-found</code></td>
        <td>Store was not found</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>429</code></td>
        <td><code>rate-limit-exceeded</code></td>
        <td>You have exceeded the rate limit of ... requests per second</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>405</code></td>
        <td><code>method-not-allowed</code></td>
        <td>This API endpoint can only be accessed using the following HTTP methods: OPTIONS, POST</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    ## Rate limiting
    <span id="/introduction/rate-limiting"></span>

    All API endpoints limit the rate of requests in order to prevent overloading of Apify servers by misbehaving clients.

    There are two kinds of rate limits - a global rate limit and a per-resource rate limit.

    ### Global rate limit
    <span id="/introduction/rate-limiting/global-rate-limit"></span>

    The global rate limit is set to _250 000 requests per minute_.
    For [authenticated](#/introduction/authentication) requests, it is counted per user,
    and for unauthenticated requests, it is counted per IP address.

    ### Per-resource rate limit
    <span id="/introduction/rate-limiting/per-resource-rate-limit"></span>

    The default per-resource rate limit is _60 requests per second per resource_, which in this context means a single Actor, a single Actor run, a single dataset, single key-value store etc.
    The default rate limit is applied to every API endpoint except a few select ones, which have higher rate limits.
    Each API endpoint returns its rate limit in `X-RateLimit-Limit` header.

    These endpoints have a rate limit of _200 requests per second per resource_:

    * CRUD ([get](#/reference/key-value-stores/record/get-record),
      [put](#/reference/key-value-stores/record/put-record),
      [delete](#/reference/key-value-stores/record/delete-record))
      operations on key-value store records

    These endpoints have a rate limit of _400 requests per second per resource_:
    * [Run Actor](#/reference/actors/run-collection/run-actor)
    * [Run Actor task asynchronously](#/reference/actor-tasks/runs-collection/run-task-asynchronously)
    * [Run Actor task synchronously](#/reference/actor-tasks/runs-collection/run-task-synchronously)
    * [Metamorph Actor run](#/reference/actors/metamorph-run/metamorph-run)
    * [Push items](#/reference/datasets/item-collection/put-items) to dataset
    * CRUD
      ([add](#/reference/request-queues/request-collection/add-request),
      [get](#/reference/request-queues/request-collection/get-request),
      [update](#/reference/request-queues/request-collection/update-request),
      [delete](#/reference/request-queues/request-collection/delete-request))
      operations on requests in request queues

    ### Rate limit exceeded errors
    <span id="/introduction/rate-limiting/rate-limit-exceeded-errors"></span>

    If the client is sending too many requests, the API endpoints respond with the HTTP status code `429 Too Many Requests`
    and the following body:

    ```
    {
        "error": {
            "type": "rate-limit-exceeded",
            "message": "You have exceeded the rate limit of ... requests per second"
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Retrying rate-limited requests with exponential backoff
    <span id="/introduction/rate-limiting/retrying-rate-limited-requests-with-exponential-backoff"></span>

    If the client receives the rate limit error, it should wait a certain period of time and then retry the request.
    If the error happens again, the client should double the wait period and retry the request,
    and so on. This algorithm is known as _exponential backoff_
    and it can be described using the following pseudo-code:

    1. Define a variable `DELAY=500`
    2. Send the HTTP request to the API endpoint
    3. If the response has status code not equal to `429` then you are done. Otherwise:
       * Wait for a period of time chosen randomly from the interval `DELAY` to `2*DELAY` milliseconds
       * Double the future wait period by setting `DELAY = 2*DELAY`
       * Continue with step 2

    If all requests sent by the client implement the above steps,
    the client will automatically use the maximum available bandwidth for its requests.

    Note that the Apify API clients [for JavaScript](https://docs.apify.com/api/client/js)
    and [for Python](https://docs.apify.com/api/client/python)
    use the exponential backoff algorithm transparently, so that you do not need to worry about it.

    ## Referring to resources
    <span id="/introduction/referring-to-resources"></span>

    There are three main ways to refer to a resource you're accessing via API.

    - the resource ID (e.g. `iKkPcIgVvwmztduf8`)
    - `username~resourcename` - when using this access method, you will need to
    use your API token, and access will only work if you have the correct
    permissions.
    - `~resourcename` - for this, you need to use an API token, and the
    `resourcename` refers to a resource in the API token owner's account.

      - The version object contains the source code of a specific version of an Actor.
      - The `sourceType` property indicates where the source code is hosted, and based
      on its value the Version object has the following additional property:

      | **Value** | **Description**  |
      |---|---|
      | `"SOURCE_FILES"`   | Source code is comprised of multiple files specified in the `sourceFiles` array. Each item of the array is an object with the following fields:<br/> - `name`: File path and name<br/> - `format`: Format of the content, can be either `"TEXT"` or `"BASE64"`<br/> - `content`: File content<br/><br/>Source files can be shown and edited in the Apify Console's Web IDE. |
      | `"GIT_REPO"` | Source code is cloned from a Git repository, whose URL is specified in the `gitRepoUrl` field. |
      | `"TARBALL"` | Source code is downloaded using a tarball or Zip file from a URL specified in the `tarballUrl` field.  |
      |`"GITHUB_GIST"`| Source code is taken from a GitHub Gist, whose URL is specified in the `gitHubGistUrl` field. |

      The API endpoints in this section allow you to manage your Apify Actors runs.

      Some API endpoints return run objects. If a run object includes usage costs in dollars, note that these values are calculated based on your effective unit pricing at the time of the query. As a result, the dollar amounts should be treated as informational only and not as exact figures.

      For more information about platform usage and resource calculations, see the [Usage and Resources documentation](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/usage-and-resources#usage).

      This section describes API endpoints to manage Datasets.

      Dataset is a storage for structured data, where each record stored has the same attributes,
      such as online store products or real estate offers. You can imagine it as a table,
      where each object is a row and its attributes are columns. Dataset is an append-only
      storage - you can only add new records to it but you cannot modify or remove existing
      records. Typically it is used to store crawling results.

      For more information, see the [Datasets documentation](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/dataset).

      :::note

      Some of the endpoints do not require the authentication token, the calls
      are authenticated using the hard-to-guess ID of the dataset.

      This section describes API endpoints to manage Key-value stores.
      Key-value store is a simple storage for saving and reading data records or files.
      Each data record is represented by a unique key and associated with a MIME content type.
      Key-value stores are ideal for saving screenshots, Actor inputs and outputs, web pages,
      PDFs or to persist the state of crawlers.

      For more information, see the [Key-value store documentation](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/key-value-store).

      Request queue is a storage for a queue of HTTP URLs to crawl, which is typically
      used for deep crawling of websites where you
      start with several URLs and then recursively follow links to other pages.
      The storage supports both breadth-first and depth-first crawling orders.

      Schedules are used to automatically start your Actors at certain times. Each schedule
      can be associated with a number of Actors and Actor tasks. It is also possible
      to override the settings of each Actor (task) similarly to when invoking the Actor
      (task) using the API.
      For more information, see [Schedules documentation](https://docs.apify.com/platform/schedules).

      Each schedule is assigned actions for it to perform. Actions can be of two types
      - `RUN_ACTOR` and `RUN_ACTOR_TASK`.

        Gets the list of all Actors that the user created or used. The response is a
        list of objects, where each object contains a basic information about a single Actor.

        To only get Actors created by the user, add the `my=1` query parameter.

        The endpoint supports pagination using the `limit` and `offset` parameters
        and it will not return more than 1000 records.

        By default, the records are sorted by the `createdAt` field in ascending
        order, therefore you can use pagination to incrementally fetch all Actors while new
        ones are still being created. To sort the records in descending order, use the `desc=1` parameter.

        You can also sort by your last run by using the `sortBy=stats.lastRunStartedAt` query parameter.
        In this case, descending order means the most recently run Actor appears first.

      summary: Create Actor
      description: |
        Creates a new Actor with settings specified in an Actor object passed as
        JSON in the POST payload.
        The response is the full Actor object as returned by the
        [Get Actor](#/reference/actors/actor-object/get-actor) endpoint.

        The HTTP request must have the `Content-Type: application/json` HTTP header!

        The Actor needs to define at least one version of the source code.
        For more information, see [Version object](#/reference/actors/version-object).

        If you want to make your Actor
        [public](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/publishing) using `isPublic:
        true`, you will need to provide the Actor's `title` and the `categories`
        under which that Actor will be classified in Apify Store. For this, it's
        best to use the [constants from our `apify-shared-js`

      summary: Update Actor
      description: |
        Updates settings of an Actor using values specified by an Actor object
        passed as JSON in the POST payload.
        If the object does not define a specific property, its value will not be
        updated.

        The response is the full Actor object as returned by the
        [Get Actor](#/reference/actors/actor-object/get-actor) endpoint.

        The request needs to specify the `Content-Type: application/json` HTTP header!

        When providing your API authentication token, we recommend using the
        request's `Authorization` header, rather than the URL. ([More
        info](#/introduction/authentication)).

        If you want to make your Actor
        [public](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/publishing) using `isPublic:
        true`, you will need to provide the Actor's `title` and the `categories`
        under which that Actor will be classified in Apify Store. For this, it's
        best to use the [constants from our `apify-shared-js`
        package](https://github.com/apify/apify-shared-js/blob/2d43ebc41ece9ad31cd6525bd523fb86939bf860/packages/consts/src/consts.ts#L452-L471).

      summary: Create version
      description: |
        Creates a version of an Actor using values specified in a [Version
        object](#/reference/actors/version-object) passed as JSON in the POST
        payload.

        The request must specify `versionNumber` and `sourceType` parameters (as
        strings) in the JSON payload and a `Content-Type: application/json` HTTP
        header.

        Each `sourceType` requires its own additional properties to be passed to the
        JSON payload object. These are outlined in the [Version
        object](#/reference/actors/version-object) table below and in more detail in
        the [Apify
        documentation](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/deployment/source-types).

        For example, if an Actor's source code is stored in a [GitHub
        repository](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/deployment/source-types#git-repository),
        you will set the `sourceType` to `GIT_REPO` and pass the repository's URL in
        the `gitRepoUrl` property.

        ```
        {
            "versionNumber": "0.1",
            "sourceType": "GIT_REPO",
            "gitRepoUrl": "https://github.com/my-github-account/actor-repo"
        }
        ```

        The response is the [Version object](#/reference/actors/version-object) as
        returned by the [Get version](#/reference/actors/version-object/get-version) endpoint.

        If the object does not define a specific property, its value will not be

        The request needs to specify the `Content-Type: application/json` HTTP

        When providing your API authentication token, we recommend using the
        request's `Authorization` header, rather than the URL. ([More

        Get the OpenAPI definition for Actor builds. Two similar endpoints are available:

        - [First endpoint](/api/v2/act-openapi-json-get): Requires both `actorId` and `buildId`. Use `default` as the `buildId` to get the OpenAPI schema for the default Actor build.

        - [Second endpoint](/api/v2/actor-build-openapi-json-get): Requires only `buildId`.

        Get the OpenAPI definition for a specific Actor build.

        To fetch the default Actor build, simply pass `default` as the `buildId`.
        Authentication is based on the build's unique ID. No authentication token is required.

        :::note

        You can also use the [`/api/v2/actor-build-openapi-json-get`](/api/v2/actor-build-openapi-json-get) endpoint to get the OpenAPI definition for a build.

      summary: Get list of runs
      description: |
        Gets the list of runs of a specific Actor. The response is a list of
        objects, where each object contains basic information about a single Actor run.

        The endpoint supports pagination using the `limit` and `offset` parameters
        and it will not return more than 1000 array elements.

        By default, the records are sorted by the `startedAt` field in ascending
        order, therefore you can use pagination to incrementally fetch all records while
        new ones are still being created. To sort the records in descending order, use
        `desc=1` parameter. You can also filter runs by status ([available
        statuses](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/runs-and-builds#lifecycle)).

      summary: Run Actor
      description: |
        Runs an Actor and immediately returns without waiting for the run to finish.

        The POST payload including its `Content-Type` header is passed as `INPUT` to
        the Actor (usually `application/json`).

        The Actor is started with the default options; you can override them using
        various URL query parameters.

        The response is the Run object as returned by the [Get
        run](#/reference/actor-runs/run-object-and-its-storages/get-run) API
        endpoint.

        If you want to wait for the run to finish and receive the actual output of
        the Actor as the response, please use one of the [Run Actor
        synchronously](#/reference/actors/run-actor-synchronously) API endpoints
        instead.

        To fetch the Actor run results that are typically stored in the default
        dataset, you'll need to pass the ID received in the `defaultDatasetId` field
        received in the response JSON to the [Get dataset items](#/reference/datasets/item-collection/get-items)
        API endpoint.

      summary: Run Actor synchronously with input and return output
      description: |
        Runs a specific Actor and returns its output.

        The POST payload including its `Content-Type` header is passed as `INPUT` to
        the Actor (usually <code>application/json</code>).
        The HTTP response contains Actors `OUTPUT` record from its default
        key-value store.

        The Actor is started with the default options; you can override them using
        various URL query parameters.
        If the Actor run exceeds 300<!-- MAX_ACTOR_JOB_SYNC_WAIT_SECS --> seconds,
        the HTTP response will have status 408 (Request Timeout).

        Beware that it might be impossible to maintain an idle HTTP connection for a
        long period of time, due to client timeout or network conditions. Make sure your HTTP client is
        configured to have a long enough connection timeout.
        If the connection breaks, you will not receive any information about the run
        and its status.

        To run the Actor asynchronously, use the [Run
        Actor](#/reference/actors/run-collection/run-actor) API endpoint instead.

      summary: Run Actor synchronously without input and get dataset items
      description: |
        Runs a specific Actor and returns its dataset items.
        The run must finish in 300<!-- MAX_ACTOR_JOB_SYNC_WAIT_SECS --> seconds
        otherwise the API endpoint returns a timeout error.
        The Actor is not passed any input.

        It allows to send all possible options in parameters from [Get Dataset
        Items](#/reference/datasets/item-collection/get-items) API endpoint.

        Beware that it might be impossible to maintain an idle HTTP connection for a
        long period of time,
        due to client timeout or network conditions. Make sure your HTTP client is
        configured to have a long enough connection timeout.
        If the connection breaks, you will not receive any information about the run
        and its status.

        To run the Actor asynchronously, use the [Run
        Actor](#/reference/actors/run-collection/run-actor) API endpoint instead.

            For example, with `flatten="foo"` the object `{"foo":{"bar": "hello"}}` is turned into `{"foo.bar": "hello"}`.
            The original object with properties is replaced with the flattened object.

      description: |
        **[DEPRECATED]** API endpoints related to run of the Actor were moved under
        new namespace [`actor-runs`](#/reference/actor-runs).Resurrects a finished
        Actor run and returns an object that contains all the details about the
        resurrected run.

        Only finished runs, i.e. runs with status `FINISHED`, `FAILED`, `ABORTED`
        and `TIMED-OUT` can be resurrected.
        Run status will be updated to RUNNING and its container will be restarted
        with the same storages
        (the same behaviour as when the run gets migrated to the new server).

        docs](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/runs-and-builds#resurrection-of-finished-run).

      description: |
        This is not a single endpoint, but an entire group of endpoints that lets you to
        retrieve and manage the last run of given Actor or any of its default storages.
        All the endpoints require an authentication token.

        The endpoints accept the same HTTP methods and query parameters as
        the respective storage endpoints.
        The base path represents the last Actor run object is:

        `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last{?token,status}`

        Using the `status` query parameter you can ensure to only get a run with a certain status
        (e.g. `status=SUCCEEDED`). The output of this endpoint and other query parameters
        are the same as in the [Run object](#/reference/actors/run-object) endpoint.

        In order to access the default storages of the last Actor run, i.e. log, key-value store, dataset and request queue,
        use the following endpoints:

        * `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/log{?token,status}`
        * `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/key-value-store{?token,status}`
        * `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/dataset{?token,status}`
        * `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/request-queue{?token,status}`

        These API endpoints have the same usage as the equivalent storage endpoints.
        For example,
        `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/key-value-store` has the same HTTP method and parameters as the
        [Key-value store object](#/reference/key-value-stores/store-object) endpoint.

        Additionally, each of the above API endpoints supports all sub-endpoints
        of the original one:

        #### Key-value store

        * `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/key-value-store/keys{?token,status}` [Key collection](#/reference/key-value-stores/key-collection)
        * `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/key-value-store/records/{recordKey}{?token,status}` [Record](#/reference/key-value-stores/record)

        #### Dataset

        * `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/dataset/items{?token,status}` [Item collection](#/reference/datasets/item-collection)

        #### Request queue

        * `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/request-queue/requests{?token,status}` [Request collection](#/reference/request-queues/request-collection)
        * `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/request-queue/requests/{requestId}{?token,status}` [Request collection](#/reference/request-queues/request)
        * `/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/request-queue/head{?token,status}` [Queue head](#/reference/request-queues/queue-head)

        For example, to download data from a dataset of the last succeeded Actor run in XML format,
        send HTTP GET request to the following URL:

        ```
        https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/{actorId}/runs/last/dataset/items?token={yourApiToken}&format=xml&status=SUCCEEDED
        ```

        In order to save new items to the dataset, send HTTP POST request with JSON payload to the same URL.

        **[DEPRECATED]** API endpoints related to run of the Actor were moved under
        new namespace [`actor-runs`](#/reference/actor-runs).

        Gets an object that contains all the details about a specific run of an Actor.

        By passing the optional `waitForFinish` parameter the API endpoint will
        synchronously wait for the run to finish.
        This is useful to avoid periodic polling when waiting for Actor run to
        complete.

        This endpoint does not require the authentication token. Instead, calls are authenticated using a hard-to-guess ID of the run. However,
        if you access the endpoint without the token, certain attributes, such as `usageUsd` and `usageTotalUsd`, will be hidden.

      summary: Metamorph run
      description: |
        **[DEPRECATED]** API endpoints related to run of the Actor were moved under
        new namespace [`actor-runs`](#/reference/actor-runs).Transforms an Actor run
        into a run of another Actor with a new input.

        This is useful if you want to use another Actor to finish the work
        of your current Actor run, without the need to create a completely new run
        and waiting for its finish.
        For the users of your Actors, the metamorph operation is transparent, they
        will just see your Actor got the work done.

        There is a limit on how many times you can metamorph a single run. You can
        check the limit in [the Actor runtime limits](https://docs.apify.com/platform/limits#actor-limits).

        Internally, the system stops the Docker container corresponding to the Actor
        run and starts a new container using a different Docker image.
        All the default storages are preserved and the new input is stored under the
        `INPUT-METAMORPH-1` key in the same default key-value store.

        For more information, see the [Actor
        docs](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/programming-interface/metamorph).

      summary: Get list of tasks
      description: |
        Gets the complete list of tasks that a user has created or used.

        The response is a list of objects in which each object contains essential
        information about a single task.

        The endpoint supports pagination using the `limit` and `offset` parameters,
        and it does not return more than a 1000 records.

        By default, the records are sorted by the `createdAt` field in ascending
        order; therefore you can use pagination to incrementally fetch all tasks while new
        ones are still being created. To sort the records in descending order, use
        the `desc=1` parameter.

      description: |
        Get a list of runs of a specific task. The response is a list of objects,
        where each object contains essential information about a single task run.

        The endpoint supports pagination using the `limit` and `offset` parameters,
        and it does not return more than a 1000 array elements.

        By default, the records are sorted by the `startedAt` field in ascending
        order; therefore you can use pagination to incrementally fetch all records while
        new ones are still being created. To sort the records in descending order, use
        the `desc=1` parameter. You can also filter runs by status ([available
        statuses](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/runs-and-builds#lifecycle)).

      summary: Run task
      description: |
        Runs an Actor task and immediately returns without waiting for the run to
        finish.

        Optionally, you can override the Actor input configuration by passing a JSON
        object as the POST payload and setting the `Content-Type: application/json` HTTP header.

        Note that if the object in the POST payload does not define a particular
        input property, the Actor run uses the default value defined by the task (or Actor's input
        schema if not defined by the task).

        The response is the Actor Run object as returned by the [Get
        run](#/reference/actor-runs/run-object-and-its-storages/get-run) endpoint.

        If you want to wait for the run to finish and receive the actual output of
        the Actor run as the response, use one of the [Run task
        synchronously](#/reference/actor-tasks/run-task-synchronously) API endpoints
        instead.

        To fetch the Actor run results that are typically stored in the default
        dataset, you'll need to pass the ID received in the `defaultDatasetId` field
        received in the response JSON to the
        [Get dataset items](#/reference/datasets/item-collection/get-items) API endpoint.

      summary: Run task synchronously
      description: |
        Runs an Actor task and synchronously returns its output.

        The run must finish in 300<!-- MAX_ACTOR_JOB_SYNC_WAIT_SECS --> seconds
        otherwise the HTTP request fails with a timeout error (this won't abort
        the run itself).

        Optionally, you can override the Actor input configuration by passing a JSON
        object as the POST payload and setting the `Content-Type: application/json` HTTP header.

        Note that if the object in the POST payload does not define a particular
        input property, the Actor run uses the default value defined by the task (or Actor's input
        schema if not defined by the task).

        Beware that it might be impossible to maintain an idle HTTP connection for
        an extended period, due to client timeout or network conditions. Make sure your HTTP client is
        configured to have a long enough connection timeout.

        If the connection breaks, you will not receive any information about the run
        and its status.

        Input fields from Actor task configuration can be overloaded with values
        passed as the POST payload.

        Just make sure to specify `Content-Type` header to be `application/json` and
        input to be an object.

        To run the task asynchronously, use the [Run
        task](#/reference/actor-tasks/run-collection/run-task) API endpoint instead.

      summary: Run task synchronously and get dataset items
      description: |
        Runs an Actor task and synchronously returns its dataset items.

        The run must finish in 300<!-- MAX_ACTOR_JOB_SYNC_WAIT_SECS --> seconds
        otherwise the HTTP request fails with a timeout error (this won't abort
        the run itself).

        Optionally, you can override the Actor input configuration by passing a JSON
        object as the POST payload and setting the `Content-Type: application/json` HTTP header.

        Note that if the object in the POST payload does not define a particular
        input property, the Actor run uses the default value defined by the task (or the Actor's
        input schema if not defined by the task).

        You can send all the same options in parameters as the [Get Dataset
        Items](#/reference/datasets/item-collection/get-items) API endpoint.

        Beware that it might be impossible to maintain an idle HTTP connection for
        an extended period, due to client timeout or network conditions. Make sure your HTTP client is
        configured to have a long enough connection timeout.

        If the connection breaks, you will not receive any information about the run
        and its status.

        Input fields from Actor task configuration can be overloaded with values
        passed as the POST payload.

        Just make sure to specify the `Content-Type` header as `application/json`
        and that the input is an object.

        To run the task asynchronously, use the [Run
        task](#/reference/actor-tasks/run-collection/run-task) API endpoint instead.

      summary: Get last run
      description: |
        This is not a single endpoint, but an entire group of endpoints that lets you to
        retrieve and manage the last run of given actor task or any of its default storages.
        All the endpoints require an authentication token.

        The endpoints accept the same HTTP methods and query parameters as
        the respective storage endpoints.
        The base path represents the last actor task run object is:

        `/v2/actor-tasks/{actorTaskId}/runs/last{?token,status}`

        Using the `status` query parameter you can ensure to only get a run with a certain status
        (e.g. `status=SUCCEEDED`). The output of this endpoint and other query parameters
        are the same as in the [Run object](/api/v2/actor-run-get) endpoint.

        In order to access the default storages of the last actor task run, i.e. log, key-value store, dataset and request queue,
        use the following endpoints:

        * `/v2/actor-tasks/{actorTaskId}/runs/last/log{?token,status}`
        * `/v2/actor-tasks/{actorTaskId}/runs/last/key-value-store{?token,status}`
        * `/v2/actor-tasks/{actorTaskId}/runs/last/dataset{?token,status}`
        * `/v2/actor-tasks/{actorTaskId}/runs/last/request-queue{?token,status}`

        These API endpoints have the same usage as the equivalent storage endpoints.
        For example,
        `/v2/actor-tasks/{actorTaskId}/runs/last/key-value-store` has the same HTTP method and parameters as the
        [Key-value store object](/api/v2/storage-key-value-stores) endpoint.

        Additionally, each of the above API endpoints supports all sub-endpoints
        of the original one:

        ##### Storage endpoints

        * [Dataset - introduction](/api/v2/storage-datasets)

        * [Key-value store - introduction](/api/v2/storage-key-value-stores)

        * [Request queue - introduction](/api/v2/storage-request-queues)

        For example, to download data from a dataset of the last succeeded actor task run in XML format,
        send HTTP GET request to the following URL:

        ```
        https://api.apify.com/v2/actor-tasks/{actorTaskId}/runs/last/dataset/items?token={yourApiToken}&format=xml&status=SUCCEEDED
        ```

        In order to save new items to the dataset, send HTTP POST request with JSON payload to the same URL.

      description: |
        Gets a list of all runs for a user. The response is a list of objects, where
        each object contains basic information about a single Actor run.

        The endpoint supports pagination using the `limit` and `offset` parameters
        and it will not return more than 1000 array elements.

        By default, the records are sorted by the `startedAt` field in ascending
        order. Therefore, you can use pagination to incrementally fetch all records while
        new ones are still being created. To sort the records in descending order, use
        `desc=1` parameter. You can also filter runs by `startedAt`` and `status`` fields ([available
        statuses](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/runs-and-builds#lifecycle)).

      summary: Get run
      description: |
        This is not a single endpoint, but an entire group of endpoints that lets
        you retrieve the run or any of its default storages.

        The endpoints accept the same HTTP methods and query parameters as
        the respective storage endpoints.

        The base path that represents the Actor run object is:

        `/v2/actor-runs/{runId}{?token}`

        In order to access the default storages of the Actor run, i.e. log,
        key-value store, dataset and request queue, use the following endpoints:

        * `/v2/actor-runs/{runId}/log{?token}`
        * `/v2/actor-runs/{runId}/key-value-store{?token}`
        * `/v2/actor-runs/{runId}/dataset{?token}`
        * `/v2/actor-runs/{runId}/request-queue{?token}`

        These API endpoints have the same usage as the equivalent storage endpoints.

        For example, `/v2/actor-runs/{runId}/key-value-store` has the same HTTP method and
        parameters as the [Key-value store object](#/reference/key-value-stores/store-object) endpoint.

        Additionally, each of the above API endpoints supports all sub-endpoints
        of the original one:

        #### Log

        * `/v2/actor-runs/{runId}/log` [Log](#/reference/logs)

        #### Key-value store

        * `/v2/actor-runs/{runId}/key-value-store/keys{?token}` [Key
        collection](#/reference/key-value-stores/key-collection)
        * `/v2/actor-runs/{runId}/key-value-store/records/{recordKey}{?token}`
        [Record](#/reference/key-value-stores/record)

        #### Dataset

        * `/v2/actor-runs/{runId}/dataset/items{?token}` [Item
        collection](#/reference/datasets/item-collection)

        #### Request queue

        * `/v2/actor-runs/{runId}/request-queue/requests{?token}` [Request
        collection](#/reference/request-queues/request-collection)
        * `/v2/actor-runs/{runId}/request-queue/requests/{requestId}{?token}`
        [Request collection](#/reference/request-queues/request)
        * `/v2/actor-runs/{runId}/request-queue/head{?token}` [Queue
        head](#/reference/request-queues/queue-head)

        For example, to download data from a dataset of the Actor run in XML format,
        send HTTP GET request to the following URL:

        ```
        https://api.apify.com/v2/actor-runs/{runId}/dataset/items?format=xml
        ```

        In order to save new items to the dataset, send HTTP POST request with JSON
        payload to the same URL.

        Gets an object that contains all the details about a
        specific run of an Actor.

        By passing the optional `waitForFinish` parameter the API endpoint will synchronously wait
        for the run to finish. This is useful to avoid periodic polling when waiting for Actor run to complete.

        This endpoint does not require the authentication token. Instead, calls are authenticated using a hard-to-guess ID of the run. However,
        if you access the endpoint without the token, certain attributes, such as `usageUsd` and `usageTotalUsd`, will be hidden.

            If the run finishes in time then the returned run object will have a terminal status (e.g. `SUCCEEDED`),
            otherwise it will have a transitional status (e.g. `RUNNING`).

      summary: Update run
      description: |
        This endpoint can be used to update both the run's status message and to configure its general resource access level.

        **Status message:**

        You can set a single status message on your run that will be displayed in
        the Apify Console UI. During an Actor run, you will typically do this in order
        to inform users of your Actor about the Actor's progress.

        The request body must contain `runId` and `statusMessage` properties. The
        `isStatusMessageTerminal` property is optional and it indicates if the
        status message is the very last one. In the absence of a status message, the
        platform will try to substitute sensible defaults.

        **General resource access:**

        You can also update the run's general resource access setting, which determines who can view the run and its related data.

        Allowed values:

        * `FOLLOW_USER_SETTING` - The run inherits the general access setting from the account level.
        * `ANYONE_WITH_ID_CAN_READ` - The run can be viewed anonymously by anyone who has its ID.
        * `RESTRICTED` - Only users with explicit access to the resource can access the run.

        When a run is accessible anonymously, all of the run's default storages and logs also become accessible anonymously.

      summary: Metamorph run
      description: |
        Transforms an Actor run into a run of another Actor with a new input.

        This is useful if you want to use another Actor to finish the work
        of your current Actor run, without the need to create a completely new run
        and waiting for its finish.

        For the users of your Actors, the metamorph operation is transparent, they
        will just see your Actor got the work done.

        Internally, the system stops the Docker container corresponding to the Actor
        run and starts a new container using a different Docker image.

        All the default storages are preserved and the new input is stored under the
        `INPUT-METAMORPH-1` key in the same default key-value store.

        For more information, see the [Actor docs](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/programming-interface/metamorph).

        Resurrects a finished Actor run and returns an object that contains all the details about the resurrected run.
        Only finished runs, i.e. runs with status `FINISHED`, `FAILED`, `ABORTED` and `TIMED-OUT` can be resurrected.
        Run status will be updated to RUNNING and its container will be restarted with the same storages
        (the same behaviour as when the run gets migrated to the new server).

        Charge for events in the run of your [pay per event Actor](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/actors-in-store#pay-per-event).
        The event you are charging for must be one of the configured events in your Actor. If the Actor is not set up as pay per event, or if the event is not configured,
        the endpoint will return an error. The endpoint must be called from the Actor run itself, with the same API token that the run was started with.

        The endpoint supports pagination using the `limit` and `offset` parameters
        and it will not return more than 1000 records.

        By default, the records are sorted by the `startedAt` field in ascending

        new ones are still being started. To sort the records in descending order, use
        the `desc=1` parameter.

        By passing the optional `waitForFinish` parameter the API endpoint will
        synchronously wait for the build to finish. This is useful to avoid periodic
        polling when waiting for an Actor build to finish.

        This endpoint does not require the authentication token. Instead, calls are authenticated using a hard-to-guess ID of the build. However,
        if you access the endpoint without the token, certain attributes, such as `usageUsd` and `usageTotalUsd`, will be hidden.

        object as returned by the [Get store](#/reference/key-value-stores/store-object/get-store)
        endpoint.

        Keep in mind that data stored under unnamed store follows [data retention
        period](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage#data-retention).

        It creates a store with the given name if the parameter name is used.
        If there is another store with the same name, the endpoint does not create a
        new one and returns the existing object instead.

        client with decompression support, the `Accept-Encoding` header is set by
        the client and body is decompressed automatically.

        Stores a value under a specific key to the key-value store.

        The value is passed as the PUT payload and it is stored with a MIME content
        type defined by the `Content-Type` header and with encoding defined by the
        `Content-Encoding` header.

        To save bandwidth, storage, and speed up your upload, send the request
        payload compressed with Gzip compression and add the `Content-Encoding: gzip`
        header. It is possible to set up another compression type with `Content-Encoding`
        request header.

        Below is a list of supported `Content-Encoding` types.

        * Gzip compression: `Content-Encoding: gzip`
        * Deflate compression: `Content-Encoding: deflate`
        * Brotli compression: `Content-Encoding: br`

        The response is a JSON array of objects,
        where each object contains basic information about one dataset.

        By default, the objects are sorted by the `createdAt` field in ascending
        order, therefore you can use pagination to incrementally fetch all datasets while new
        ones are still being created. To sort them in descending order, use `desc=1`
        parameter. The endpoint supports pagination using `limit` and `offset`
        parameters and it will not return more than 1000 array elements.

      description: |
        Returns data stored in the dataset in a desired format.

        ### Response format

        The format of the response depends on <code>format</code> query parameter.

        The <code>format</code> parameter can have one of the following values:
        <code>json</code>, <code>jsonl</code>, <code>xml</code>, <code>html</code>,
        <code>csv</code>, <code>xlsx</code> and <code>rss</code>.

        The following table describes how each format is treated.

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Format</th>
            <th>Items</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>json</code></td>
            <td rowspan="3">The response is a JSON, JSONL or XML array of raw item objects.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>jsonl</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>xml</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>html</code></td>
            <td rowspan="3">The response is a HTML, CSV or XLSX table, where columns correspond to the
            properties of the item and rows correspond to each dataset item.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>csv</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>xlsx</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>rss</code></td>
            <td colspan="2">The response is a RSS file. Each item is displayed as child elements of one
            <code>&lt;item&gt;</code>.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        Note that CSV, XLSX and HTML tables are limited to 2000 columns and the column names cannot be longer than 200 characters.
        JSON, XML and RSS formats do not have such restrictions.

        ### Hidden fields

        The top-level fields starting with the `#` character are considered hidden.
        These are useful to store debugging information and can be omitted from the output by providing the `skipHidden=1` or `clean=1` query parameters.
        For example, if you store the following object to the dataset:

        ```
        {
            productName: "iPhone Xs",
            description: "Welcome to the big screens."
            #debug: {
                url: "https://www.apple.com/lae/iphone-xs/",
                crawledAt: "2019-01-21T16:06:03.683Z"
            }
        }
        ```

        The `#debug` field will be considered as hidden and can be omitted from the
        results. This is useful to
        provide nice cleaned data to end users, while keeping debugging info
        available if needed. The Dataset object
        returned by the API contains the number of such clean items in the`dataset.cleanItemCount` property.

        ### XML format extension

        When exporting results to XML or RSS formats, the names of object properties become XML tags and the corresponding values become tag's children. For example, the following JavaScript object:

        ```
        {
            name: "Paul Newman",
            address: [
                { type: "home", street: "21st", city: "Chicago" },
                { type: "office", street: null, city: null }
            ]
        }
        ```

        will be transformed to the following XML snippet:

        ```
        <name>Paul Newman</name>
        <address>
          <type>home</type>
          <street>21st</street>
          <city>Chicago</city>
        </address>
        <address>
          <type>office</type>
          <street/>
          <city/>
        </address>
        ```

        If the JavaScript object contains a property named `@` then its sub-properties are exported as attributes of the parent XML
        element.
        If the parent XML element does not have any child elements then its value is taken from a JavaScript object property named `#`.

        For example, the following JavaScript object:

        ```
        {
          "address": [{
            "@": {
              "type": "home"
            },
            "street": "21st",
            "city": "Chicago"
          },
          {
            "@": {
              "type": "office"
            },
            "#": 'unknown'
          }]
        }
        ```

        will be transformed to the following XML snippet:

        ```
        <address type="home">
          <street>21st</street>
          <city>Chicago</city>
        </address>
        <address type="office">unknown</address>
        ```

        This feature is also useful to customize your RSS feeds generated for various websites.

        By default the whole result is wrapped in a `<items>` element and each page object is wrapped in a `<item>` element.
        You can change this using <code>xmlRoot</code> and <code>xmlRow</code> url parameters.

        ### Pagination

        The generated response supports [pagination](#/introduction/pagination).
        The pagination is always performed with the granularity of a single item, regardless whether <code>unwind</code> parameter was provided.
        By default, the **Items** in the response are sorted by the time they were stored to the database, therefore you can use pagination to incrementally fetch the items as they are being added.
        No limit exists to how many items can be returned in one response.

        If you specify `desc=1` query parameter, the results are returned in the reverse order than they were stored (i.e. from newest to oldest items).
        Note that only the order of **Items** is reversed, but not the order of the `unwind` array elements.

            If the unwound field is an object then it is merged with the parent object.
            If the unwound field is missing or its value is neither an array nor an object and therefore cannot be merged with a parent object then the item gets preserved as it is.
            Note that the unwound items ignore the `desc` parameter.

        Appends an item or an array of items to the end of the dataset.
        The POST payload is a JSON object or a JSON array of objects to save into the dataset.

        If the data you attempt to store in the dataset is invalid (meaning any of the items received by the API fails the validation), the whole request is discarded and the API will return a response with status code 400.
        For more information about dataset schema validation, see [Dataset schema](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/actor-definition/dataset-schema/validation).

        **IMPORTANT:** The limit of request payload size for the dataset is 5 MB. If the array exceeds the size, you'll need to split it into a number of smaller arrays.

        ones are still being created. To sort them in descending order, use `desc=1`
        parameter. The endpoint supports pagination using `limit` and `offset`
        parameters and it will not return more than 1000
        array elements.

      summary: Create webhook
      description: |
        Creates a new webhook with settings provided by the webhook object passed as
        JSON in the payload.
        The response is the created webhook object.

        To avoid duplicating a webhook, use the `idempotencyKey` parameter in the
        request body.
        Multiple calls to create a webhook with the same `idempotencyKey` will only
        create the webhook with the first call and return the existing webhook on
        subsequent calls.
        Idempotency keys must be unique, so use a UUID or another random string with
        enough entropy.

        To assign the new webhook to an Actor or task, the request body must contain
        `requestUrl`, `eventTypes`, and `condition` properties.

        * `requestUrl` is the webhook's target URL, to which data is sent as a POST
        request with a JSON payload.
        * `eventTypes` is a list of events that will trigger the webhook, e.g. when
        the Actor run succeeds.
        * `condition` should be an object containing the ID of the Actor or task to
        which the webhook will be assigned.
        * `payloadTemplate` is a JSON-like string, whose syntax is extended with the
        use of variables.
        * `headersTemplate` is a JSON-like string, whose syntax is extended with the
        use of variables. Following values will be re-written to defaults: "host",
        "Content-Type", "X-Apify-Webhook", "X-Apify-Webhook-Dispatch-Id",
        "X-Apify-Request-Origin"
        * `description` is an optional string.
        * `shouldInterpolateStrings` is a boolean indicating whether to interpolate
        variables contained inside strings in the `payloadTemplate`

        ```
            "isAdHoc" : false,
            "requestUrl" : "https://example.com",
            "eventTypes" : [

        Gets the list of public Actors in Apify Store. You can use `search`
        parameter to search Actors by string in title, name, description, username
        and readme.
        If you need detailed info about a specific Actor, use the [Get
        Actor](#/reference/actors/actor-object/get-actor) endpoint.

        The endpoint supports pagination using the `limit` and `offset` parameters.
        It will not return more than 1,000 records.

        Use your API token to authenticate requests. You can find it on the [Integrations page](https://console.apify.com/account#/integrations) in Apify Console. This method is more secure than query parameters, as headers are not logged in browser history or server logs.

        :::danger Security

        Do not share your API token (or account password) with untrusted parties.

        :::

        _When is authentication required?_
        - _Required_ for private Actors, tasks, or resources (e.g., builds of private Actors).
        - _Required_ when using named formats for IDs (e.g., `username~store-name` for stores or `username~queue-name` for queues).
        - _Optional_ for public Actors or resources (e.g., builds of public Actors can be queried without a token).

        For more information, see our [integrations documentation](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations).

            An object to modify tags on the Actor's builds. The key is the tag name (e.g., _latest_), and the value is either an object with a `buildId` or `null`.

            This operation is a patch; any existing tags that you omit from this object will be preserved.

            - **To create or reassign a tag**, provide the tag name with a `buildId`. e.g., to assign the _latest_ tag:

              &nbsp;

              ```json
              {
                "latest": {
                  "buildId": "z2EryhbfhgSyqj6Hn"
                }
              }
              ```

            - **To remove a tag**, provide the tag name with a `null` value. e.g., to remove the _beta_ tag:

              &nbsp;

              ```json
              {
                "beta": null
              }
              ```

            - **To perform multiple operations**, combine them. The following reassigns _latest_ and removes _beta_, while preserving any other existing tags.

              &nbsp;

              ```json
              {
                "latest": {
                  "buildId": "z2EryhbfhgSyqj6Hn"
                },
                "beta": null

            Apify securely stores your ten most recent Actor runs indefinitely, ensuring they are always accessible. Unnamed storages and other Actor runs are automatically deleted after the retention period. If you're subscribed, you can change it to keep data for longer or to limit your usage.

        Specifies the maximum number of dataset items that will be charged for pay-per-result Actors.

        It only ensures you won't be charged for more than this number of items.
        Only works for pay-per-result Actors.
        Value can be accessed in the actor run using `ACTOR_MAX_PAID_DATASET_ITEMS` environment variable.
